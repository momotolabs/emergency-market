    review: `Mark has been very helpful through the years by helping me with difficult claims
      adjusters that have tried to minimize claims after a loss on they’re
      property.
      Specifically emergency tree service claims.
      Claims handling,
      arbitration between arborist, and claims adjuster. He helped me navigate through
      unchartered territory even after over 25 years of insurance work experience. Mark
      still brought value to the table with his knowledge and experience of thousands of
      claims that have successfully paidInFull. Insurance carriers have a long history of
      not wanting to pay when the bill is owed. We need more collaboration in our
      industry. Marks new views in a old industry are making big changes for the
      better. I will continue to work with mark in the future.
